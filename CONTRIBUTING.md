# Contribution Guidelines

We follow the Contributor Covenant. You can read it, and where to report abuse in our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to fix a bug, add a feature, or just generally tinker with
`styled-system`, please start by forking the repository, and creating a new
branch. Then install dependencies by running `npm install` (we use `npm`, you're
free to use `yarn`, just take care to not commit `yarn.lock`).

You can start the documentation development server by executing `npm start`. By
default it'll run on port `8080`, but you can override this using the `--port`
flag (`npm start -- --port 3000` for example). See
[`mdx-go`](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-go)'s documentation to learn more about
its CLI options. It's set up to watch for file changes by default.

That's it! You're now ready to start working on your feature. Until we have more
documentation in place with regards to architecture & testing, please peruse
`src/index.js`, the tests in `test/index.js`, or one of the `packages`. If
you're unsure, please open a [Draft Pull
Request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/),
explain us to the best of your abilities what it is we can help you with, and
we'll try to guide you in the right direction.
